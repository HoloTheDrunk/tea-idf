The Falloux law of 1854 enabled the rise of religious secondary education. The difficult context for the Church, marked by the Dreyfus affair (1895) and the law of separation of Church and State (1905), pushed it to seek to regain influence by diffusing moral values in the business world and by training a new generation of business leaders.",

Germain Legret had opened two business schools in Paris in 1815 and 1818 but they closed their doors rapidly. It was modeled on the first Grande École, the École Polytechnique founded by Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge, but was initially much more modest, mainly because it had not been supported by the state. Since the 1820s, the school had international exposure but it was not the only business school open to international students. As the French scholar Adrien Jean-Guy Passant recalls, other business schools as well as some polytechnics with trade departments welcomed foreigners from the start of the 19th century in Europe. It gradually gained in stature and importance during the 19th century and moved to its current Parisian location on Avenue de la République in 1898.",

      "history": "EDHEC Business School was founded in 1906 by entrepreneurs from the North of France. Motte Duthoit, leading textile manufacturer and mayor of Roubaix, France, purchased the land known as “La campagne” on which EDHEC headquarters currently stand. Marcel Tiberghien, a prosperous wool industrialist from Tourcoing, and his wife Madeleine (née Vanoutryve), from a textile family from Roubaix, decided to move out of the town and house their large family in the fresh air of the countryside. The couple purchased a total of 7 hectares in Marcq-en-Baroeul and commissioned one of the greatest architects and landscapers of the time, Jacques Gréber, to design the Anglo-Norman style manor and the English gardens surrounded by century-old beech trees with a pond in the south part of the manor and a rose garden in the west part. He also built in the north part a gardener's house and a stable for three horses. Gréber is known for major projects such as the Fairmont Parkway in Philadelphia, urban plans for Montreal and Marseilles, etc.",
